<h1 color="red">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I'm Billy from Atlanta, GA, and I'm working my work towards being a fullstack Developer. I'm currently focusing on the Front-End working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I enjoy working with different frameworks in JavaScript (React, Next.js, Vue.js) and CSS (SASS, LESS, BULMA, BOOTSTRAP, TAILWIND CSS). I also have knowledge of other programming languages with regards to Python, C, C#, Java.
